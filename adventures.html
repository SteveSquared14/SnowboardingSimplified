				<h2>My Adventures</h2>
					<p>
					I hope you enjoy reading about some of the winter resorts I have been lucky enough to adventure to!
					</p>
					<p>
					There are 4 different colours (grades) of runs on a Snowboarding resort, which are Green, Blue, Red and Black. With Blue being the easiest and Black being the hardest.
					</p>
					<p>
					Of the 5 countries I have visited, Italy and Austria have been my favourite. This is because the resorts there are well sign posted and easy to navigate which means you can focus on just Snowboarding and having fun rather than
					worrying about if you're lost or not.
					</p>
					<p>
					France is my least favourite country because the blue runs in France are equivalent to the red runs in Italy and Austria due to their steepness, which made them hard to navigate. Another factor in this was that I went to France whilst
					I was a beginner Snowboarder, I feel if I went back now then I would enjoy it a lot more as my skills have greatly improved.

				Pila is a resort located in the Aosta Valley which I travelled to in 2016. When we arrived to our hotel the snow was so heavy it was a struggle to pull my suitcase through it. The hotel
				we stayed in was called the Hotel Etoile De Neige which is located approximately 18km above the old town of Aosta at the bottom of the resort. We had the ability to ski in and out of the
				hotel which was amazing as we didn't have to mess around with a cable car to get home after a long day of snowboarding.
				</p>
				<p class="Media-Text">
				Pila is a great resort as it is very snow-sure. This is because there are over 400 snow cannons dotted around which have the ability to cover upto 80% of the mountain with artificial snow, should Mother
				Nature not provide enough. It's also a great resort for beginners as the Red runs are very wide and aren't as steep as other resorts so you can build your confidence slowly without going too fast. It is
				also one of the easier resorts to navigate as all the runs are well sign posted so you know where you are at all times, plus the mountain essentially looks like a large "bowl" because all the runs filter
				down into one main run so you have to try really hard to get lost!

				Back in 2017 I went to Baquiera Beret and it was one of the more confusing resorts I have travelled to. At the time of booking the holiday, we felt we had exhausted the resorts we liked in
				Italy and Austria was a little too advanced.</p>
				<p class="Media-Text">But then we discovered Spain (Yes, Spain) had a ski resort and after some further research and a thorough review of the piste map, we'd
				booked our holiday. Now normally, when you think of a winter holiday you imagine lots of snow and freezing temperatures, but Spain was the opposite. While it was still cold, it was
				the warmest resort I have ever been to and we had wall to wall sunshine everyday. This provided some new challenging circumstances as the slopes were far too icy for snowboarding in
				the early mornings, but by mid-late afternoon the sun would melt the ice into slush which made everything so much easier. Another benefit of the sunshine was that it made for some great pictures and filming on the GoPro's.
				</p>
				<p>We also enjoyed many refreshing, cold pints of San Miguel on the sun-soaked balconies after a hard days snowboarding.</p>

				<p class="Media-Text">
				The most recent winter holdiay I have been on was to the Austrian resort of Solden in 2019. We booked this resort as we were looking for a challenge because the red runs in the Italian resorts
				weren't cutting it. Austria is one of the most popular ski destinations in Europe and this one was no exception, in fact the James Bond film Spectre actually had a scene filmed in this very resort
				and there is a James Bond inspired cafe at the highest point of the resort to commemorate this.
				</p>
				<p class="Media-Text">
				Due to the resort being more than 3,000m high we had regular snow fall throughout our time there and there was even one day where they had to close the upper parts of the mountain due to the strong
				winds that were too dangerous to snowboard in. However, we still managed to access some of the more basic runs lower down the mountain and because we were among the few people that actually ventured
				onto the mountain that day we were able to enjoy the fresh power to ourselves which was truly amazing!
