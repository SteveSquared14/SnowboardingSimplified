			<h2>Necessary Equipment</h2>
			<p>Snowboarding is an expressive sport and often seems more relaxed & fun than Skiing. Every
			one of them seems to wear some combination of the same four colours and are obsessed with who can ski the fastest. On the other hand, I have rarely ever seen two
			Snowboarders that are the same. Each one has their own style when it comes to clothing, some where colour-coordinated clothing whilst others wear colours that are complete opposites. 
			So when choosing your equipment, firstly I would make sure it fits what you want to do. But other than that, get creative and wear any colour you wish as long as it keeps you safe and warm!</p>
			<p>Equipment can get very expensive depending on what style you're into and what brand(s) you like. See below for a quick list of equipment you should look to invest in.</p>

			<h2>Clothing</h2>
			<ul class="Equipment-List">
				<li>
					Coat - When you walk into a Snowboarding shop, you'll likely be greeting with wall-to-wall displays of different coats; but they're not all equal. The easiest first step is to determine the climate
					which you'll spend most of your time in because whilst all snow is cold, there is a gigantic difference between the cold in the Chillfactore and the
					cold of a ski resort like La Thuile (approximately -3 degrees versus approximately -20 degrees). Thus if you were planning to spend most of your time in the
					Chillfactore then you have the option to choose an Overcoat/Shell style coat which allows more room in the fit but sacrificies insulation. From here,
					I would recommend choosing a coat with a snowbelt; a snowbelt is a piece of fabric that is sewn into the bottom of the coat and fastens around your waist similar to a traditional belt and keeps
					the snow out when you fall over. My final reccomendation would be to choose a size that is on the larger side because you need to allow space for 2 other layers; your fleece and your thermals
					(Discussed below)
				</li>
				<li>
					Pants - Choosing snowboarding pants is quite similar to choosing regular pants when it comes to size. There isn't as much variation in style compared to coats, but it is important that you decide
					on something comfy that you can easily bend in without stressing the seems (Don't want any splitting on the slopes!). An important aspect to consider is whether you want braces or not, I personally
					prefer pants without braces because I like a snug fit around my waist. But if that doesn't interest you then you may want to give braces a try.
				</li>
				<li>
					Gloves - Gloves work in a similar to coats in the sense that they are somewhat temperature dependant, but not as much as coats. The main two styles are a traditional fingered glove or mittens. I
					personally have the best of both worlds as my gloves are in the style of mittens, but inside they have dividers for each finger; I prefer these are there is more padding for my fingers and they
					keep my hands warmer. An valid point I feel compelled to add is that I have had no problems choosing cheaper/low-end gloves without any issue of cold hands. My first pair of gloves were very basic
					and they posed no issues, even when I wore them in temperatures of -32 degrees. So if you're on a budget you could save some money here to spend on a better coat.
				</li>
				<li>
					Fleeces & Thermals - I have grouped these two together as I always refer to them in the same category. Thermals (Or long john's if you're old fashioned) are your base layer. They provide a large
					portion of your warmth and it's important that you get a good fit. In my opinion, I would choose a smaller size than usual in order to get a tight fit whilst keeping baggy-ness to a minimum. Your
					next layer of warmth is your fleece. Microfibre fleeces are the best option here because they are very comfy and very cheap. I would advise a similar sizing strategy as with your thermals because
					the tighter the fit, the warmer you will be. This is also an area where you can go for a cheaper option with very good success (Thus saving more of your budget for a coat) and I would recommend you
					check out Decathlon or Go Outdoors.

			<h2>Helmet & Goggles</h2>

			</figure>
			<p>Okay, okay, I get it. The word helmet probably gives you flashbacks to the awful one your parents made you wear when you learnt to ride a bike and in truth they aren't much better today. <strong>
				But</strong>, they are the most important piece of equipment that you could own! In fact, I purchased my helmet about a year before i purchase my own snowboard and I've lost count of the number
				of times it has saved me when I've taken a nasty tumble down the slope. It's especially important if you want to start learning any Freestyle tricks as you'll fall a lot more.
			</p>
			<p>There are a few different styles of helmet to choose from: full face, standard, freestyle. Full face helmets are ideal for those that want to get into downhill snowboarding where you'll be
				travelling at very high speeds around marker poles, they completely cover your face and offer a lot of protection for you chin. Freestyle helmets are very similar to what
				<abbr title="Bicycle Motorcross">BMX</abbr> riders wear. They provide the bare essentials in terms of protection and place more priority on style. Finally we have the standard/generic style which
				is similar to what you would wear	when riding a bike. Here you get very good protection, but sacrifice a bit of style. When choosing sizing, you want a helemt that is comfy but doesn't wobble
				around and the helmet needs to cover the entirety of your forehead.
			</p>
			<p>I have a standard style helmet, but it has a slight peak on the front (similar to a cap) to help block sun and it also has a wheel at the back which helps to secure the back on the helmet
				(in addition to the chin strap). It also has adjustment at the back of the neck to further secure it. I bought it from a shop called Snow & Rock, and if you want to check them out 
				there's a link above which will take you to their website.
			</p>
			<p>
				Goggles are a sticking point for me. On the one hand I understand why people spend the money on the top name brands (Oakley or Dragon), but on the other I personally have had amazing success with a £9 I
				bought from Aldi on a whim when I was out shopping one day. The main important advice I can give is to try them on in the shop and make sure then lens colour is one you like. Some lens are yellow or
				orange, which are helpful as they'll provude more visibility when the resort you are in is snowing heavily but they're unnecessarily bright in pretty much any other environment. There are also mirrored
				lens, which are handy if you dont want people looking you in the eye and you want to look like a Pro from the GoPro adverts.

			<ul class="Equipment-List">
				<li>
					Freeride/All Mountain - This is the most common type of snowboard, so much so in fact, that it accounts for around half of all Snowboard sales. It is designed to be a good all-rounder and can be
					used on the mountain/slopes, in a Freestyle Park or in deep Powder. They have a directional shape, which means they are only meant to be ridden in one direction and the nose is wider &amp; longer
					than the tail. Following this trend, these Snowboards are also stiff enough that you can turn fairly sharply but are also soft so beginners can learn the basics. Think of it as a Jack of all Trades
					but Master of None.
				</li>
				<li>
					Freestyle - These Snowboards are designed to be ridden in either direction as Freestyle riders often have to ride Switch depending on what trick they perform. When compared to an All Mountain Board,
					they are wider, more stable, lighter, shorter and softer in construction so the rider has utmost control ove the board in order to perform any trick they want. As a result of their responsiveness,
					they actually make good Snowboards for beginners to learn on however they lack speed due to how flat they are and they offer poor carving ability due to their lack of edge.
				</li>
				<li>
					Carving/Alpine/Racing - These Snowboards are similar to All Mountain Snowboards because they are one directional, but the comparisons stop there. They are the stiffest, narrowest and longest
					because they are designed for going as fast as possible (Hence the name, Racing Snowboard). They also have incredibly sharp edges which allow the rider to perform great carving turns. Unless
					you're a seasoned veteran I wouldn't reccomend trying one of these boards as they are much harder to ride.
				</li>

			<h2>Bindings</h2>

				<figcaption>This is a picture of the bindings that I use on my snowboard. They are called Union Flite and are made by a company called Union and are black and yellow.</figcaption>
			</figure>
				<p>
					Bindings are where your boots are fastened to your Snowboard. Once you have your boots on you step into your Bindings and fasten two straps on a ratchet system to "clamp" your foot to your
					board. Of the two straps, the bigger one of the two is the most important as it provides the most support and pulls you ankle back and down into the Binding.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then there is the toe binding which secures the front of your foot. A large majority of Bindings use this style, but there are a few that use a "Step-In" style. The difference here is
					that the two straps are joined together as one unit and once your foot is inside, the back of the binding is lifted up and supported using a strap. This style is good when you're in & out 
					of your bindings a lot.
				</p>
				<p>Another important factor to consider is the style of hardware using to fasten your bindings to your snowboard, as this can vary depending on the manufacturer. For example, there is a company called Burton Snowboards,
				and they have developed their own mounting system which is great but it means that only Burton bindings can be used on Burton snowboards. However, they seem to be an anomaly as most other manufacturers use
				the same screw-based system. My personal reccomendation for bindings is a comapny called Union as they are reputable, used by a lot of professional Snowboarders and they have never failed me once in the 5 years I have
				used them. They also offer many different colour variations which is a nice touch.

			<h2>Boots</h2>

				<img src="Media/Equipment/Boots.jpg" alt="This is a picture of the snowboard boots that I were, made by a company called Solomon and they are a dark green colour." title="This is a picture of the snowboard boots that I were, made by a company called Solomon and they are a dark green colour.">
				<figcaption>This is a picture of the snowboard boots that I were, made by a company called Solomon and they are a dark green colour.</figcaption>
			</figure>	
				<p>How well you are able to control your snowboard is largely down to your boots. They're essential for keeping your feet warm and your toes protected whilst allowing them to breathe. I will
					advise you to play around with sizing because some brands are narrower (Such as the Salomon Boots that I own) and some are wider than your standard shoe size. Also it is very important to make
					sure that your heel is fully secured and doesn't rub or get sore when you walk around in them; you do <strong>a lot</strong> of bending and twisting whilst you ride you Snowboard and the
					last thing you want is your brand new Snowboard boots giving you blisters.
				</p>
				<p>Another factor to consider when buying your own Snowboard Boots is the type of fastening you would like. The majority of Snowboard Boots come with long laces similar to that on your trainers,
					this option is good because you have more brands and colours to choose from but I have found them hard to work with and tie effectively because the tightness depends on how well you can grip.
					In addition to this, when you're on your winter holiday and have been boarding for 6 or 7 hours per day, the last thing you want is to fight with unlacing your boots when you could be in the bar
					enjoying happy hour! A way around this is to look for Snowboard Boots with fast-lacing options. The boots themselves are pre-laced and have 1 or 2 tabs/handles which you can pull on to tighten your
					boots. I have these as they allow me to step into them, pull them tab as tight as I want, and then I'm on my way.
